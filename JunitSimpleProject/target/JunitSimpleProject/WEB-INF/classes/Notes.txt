All the following Annotation are used for methods and the annotated methods will be executing Automatically 
by Junit as shown below

 
@Test       --->if an operation/function/method/api having @Test           tag then it will execute 
                only once.


@Before     --->if an operation/function/method/api having @Before         tag then it will execute 
                before every "@Test annotated" method.
                
                
@BeforeClass--->if an operation/function/method/api having @BeforeClass    tag then it will execute 
                before every "Testing class" loaded into memory.
                
NOTE:
-----
@BeforeClass method must be "static"
                
                
@After      --->if an operation/function/method/api having @After          tag then it will execute 
                After every "@Test annotated" method.


@AfterClass --->if an operation/function/method/api having @AfterClass     tag then it will execute 
                after every "Testing class" unloaded from memory.

@AfterClass method must be "static"
                                                   
                
Execution:
----------
1. First, build the Junit related repository:
---------------------------------------------
R.C on project ---> Select "Run As"  ---> Select  "Maven Test"

NOTE:   
-----
A] Now, it will download all the Junit related jar files.
B] This above step1 must be done only once because if we download jar once then jars will be available at our local repository.


2. For Testing all the Test cases Classes present in the project use following:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 R.C on project ---> Select "Run As"  ---> Select  "JUnit Test"


3. For Testing particular the Test cases Class present in the project use following:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 R.C on Test case(s)class ---> Select "Run As"  ---> Select  "JUnit Test"
